# Scratch2.0Theme
A Scratch 2.0 theme with revisions
# How to apply
Since Scratch does not allow to mention all browser extensions, we will just call the extension used "Extension". We also reccomend disabling all other scratch-related extension for the best experience.
## Step 1:
Clone the repo, by clicking "Code" and then selected your preferred option. Then unzip the folder.
## Step 2:
Click on Extension icon on your browser bar. This will show a menu (Has to be orange since it's the style of the extension) and click on the gear icon.
## Step 3:
Click on More Settings, Import Setting and choose the JSON Named Scratch2.0Theme_x.x (has to match with the current release).
# Result
You will now see that the website looks mostly 2.0 except for the editor.
